# REQUIEMLightAndShadowTest



Note: This is the test I did for REQUIEM: Light and Shadow on 16/11/2025.



&nbsp;	Overview



Please create a very small prototype with simple shapes (no art needed).



&nbsp;		Requirements:



&nbsp;			1️) Player



* Move left/right
* Jump



&nbsp;			2️) Enemy



* Patrols between two points (back and forth)
* Slightly chases the player when close



&nbsp;			3️) Emotional Trigger



* A trigger zone that switches the game between two states:



Calm Mode

Blind Mode



This can be something simple like changing:



* background color
* a light color
* a particle effect
* a global variable

(Anything that visually communicates two emotional states.)



&nbsp;	Instructions



To test, the executable is located in: REQUIEMLightAndShadowTest\\Builds\\Windows



This folder contains both the .exe file and the .zip file.
